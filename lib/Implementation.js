// **Implementation** refers to the phase in the development process where the proposed changes, 
// as outlined in the task's **Specification** and **Plan**, are translated into actual code modifications. 
// It involves creating, updating, or removing code files to achieve the desired functionality and meet the success criteria. 
// The **Implementation** phase typically includes the following steps:
// 1. **Code Changes**: Developers make changes to the codebase based on the plan. This could involve:
//    - Writing new functions, classes, or modules.
//    - Modifying existing code to address bugs, implement new features, or improve performance.
//    - Removing obsolete or unnecessary code.
// 2. **File Modifications**: The specific files identified in the **Plan** are edited. 
// These files may include source code, configuration files, documentation, or assets, depending on the taskâ€™s scope. Each file is updated to reflect the required changes.
// 3. **Code Generation**: In some workflows, code may be auto-generated based on predefined templates or specifications. 
// For example, a system might automatically create boilerplate code for new components, such as controllers, services, or database schemas.
// 4. **Version Control Integration**: Changes are tracked using a version control system (e.g., Git), 
// ensuring that the history of changes is documented. Each modification is committed with a descriptive message, and the updated code is pushed to the repository.
// 5. **Code Review**: The changes made during the implementation are typically subject to a review process. 
// This may involve peers or automated tools to ensure code quality, adherence to best practices, and consistency with the overall architecture.
// 6. **Integration with Other Components**: The implemented code must work seamlessly with the existing system. This may involve:
//    - Integrating with other modules or services.
//    - Updating dependencies or configuration files.
//    - Ensuring backward compatibility with the rest of the system.
// 7. **Refinement**: Once initial changes are made, the code may be refined based on feedback from reviews, 
// testing results, or further analysis. Developers may iterate on the implementation to optimize performance, fix issues, or improve maintainability.
// 8. **Testing and Validation**: The implemented code is validated through automated tests (unit tests, 
// integration tests, end-to-end tests) to ensure that it functions as expected and does not introduce new bugs. 
// If needed, additional tests are written to cover new functionality or edge cases.
// The **Implementation** phase is where the bulk of development occurs, translating plans and specifications into real, 
// executable code that moves the project closer to its final goals.
