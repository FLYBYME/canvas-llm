// An **artifact** that represents a file is a structured, abstract representation of a file within the development process. It encapsulates the essential information and metadata about the file, allowing it to be managed and interacted with during various phases of software development, such as analysis, modification, and testing. The artifact typically includes:
// 1. **File Name and Path**: The name of the file and its location within the project directory structure. This helps identify the file and where it resides in the overall project.
// 2. **File Type**: The file's format (e.g., `.js`, `.css`, `.html`, `.json`), which determines its purpose and the tools required to interact with it.
// 3. **File Contents**: The actual code or data within the file. This includes any lines of code, configurations, or textual data that the file holds.
// 4. **Metadata**:
//    - **Author**: The creator or last modifier of the file.
//    - **Creation Date**: The date when the file was originally created.
//    - **Last Modified Date**: The date when the file was last updated or modified.
//    - **Version Information**: A reference to the version or commit of the file within version control, which provides a historical record of changes.
// 5. **Change History**: A record of modifications made to the file over time, typically tracked through a version control system (e.g., Git). This helps trace the evolution of the file, including what changes were made and by whom.
// 6. **Dependencies**: Information about any external files or libraries that this file interacts with or relies on. This helps ensure compatibility and understanding of the file’s role in the overall system.
// 7. **Status**: Whether the file is new, modified, deleted, or unchanged in the current context of the task. This allows the development process to track the file’s state relative to the ongoing work.
// 8. **Purpose and Role**: A description of the file’s intended role in the system, such as whether it’s a utility file, a configuration file, a part of the core functionality, or related to testing.
// The **artifact** that represents a file allows developers and systems to interact with the file in a consistent, structured manner, ensuring that it is properly managed and integrated into the broader development workflow.
