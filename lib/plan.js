// A **Plan** refers to a detailed, actionable roadmap that outlines the steps required to implement the proposed changes described in the Specification. It provides a clear path from the current state to the desired outcome, breaking down the task into smaller, manageable actions. The Plan typically includes:
// 1. **Tasks and Steps**: A step-by-step breakdown of what needs to be done. This includes specific actions, such as which files to modify, add, or remove, and any other necessary development activities (e.g., refactoring, testing).
// 2. **File and Code Modifications**: A clear listing of the files that will be affected, along with what needs to be modified in each file. This helps developers focus on the right areas of the codebase and ensures the changes are scoped appropriately.
// 3. **Dependencies and Interactions**: Identification of any related components or modules that need to be adjusted or updated to ensure the task's successful completion. This section clarifies any potential risks or impacts across the codebase.
// 4. **Timeline and Milestones**: Estimated time frames for completing each step or task, including any key milestones that need to be achieved before proceeding with further steps. 
// 5. **Testing and Validation**: Plans for testing and validating the changes, ensuring the taskâ€™s implementation meets the success criteria defined in the Specification.
// The **Plan** provides a clear, structured approach to implementing the Specification, ensuring that all necessary steps are accounted for and that the team knows what to focus on at each stage.
