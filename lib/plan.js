// A **Plan** refers to a detailed, actionable roadmap that outlines the steps required to implement the proposed changes described in the Specification. It provides a clear
//  path from the current state to the desired outcome, breaking down the task into smaller, manageable actions. The Plan typically includes:
// 1. **Tasks and Steps**: A step-by-step breakdown of what needs to be done. This includes specific actions, such as which files to modify, add, or remove, and any other 
// necessary development activities (e.g., refactoring, testing).
// 2. **File and Code Modifications**: A clear listing of the files that will be affected, along with what needs to be modified in each file. This helps developers focus on 
// the right areas of the codebase and ensures the changes are scoped appropriately.
// 3. **Dependencies and Interactions**: Identification of any related components or modules that need to be adjusted or updated to ensure the task's successful completion. 
// This section clarifies any potential risks or impacts across the codebase.
// 4. **Timeline and Milestones**: Estimated time frames for completing each step or task, including any key milestones that need to be achieved before proceeding with 
// further steps. 
// 5. **Testing and Validation**: Plans for testing and validating the changes, ensuring the taskâ€™s implementation meets the success criteria defined in the Specification.
// The **Plan** provides a clear, structured approach to implementing the Specification, ensuring that all necessary steps are accounted for and that the team knows what 
// to focus on at each stage.
