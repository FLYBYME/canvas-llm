// A **Task** in this context refers to a unit of work that requires analysis, planning, and implementation within the software development workflow. Tasks can originate from various sources, such as:  

// 1. **GitHub Issues** – Addressing bug reports, feature requests, or code improvements.  
// 2. **Codebase Enhancements** – Refactoring, optimizing, or extending existing functionality.  
// 3. **Documentation Updates** – Improving or adding documentation for clarity and maintainability.  
// 4. **Testing and Validation** – Writing or updating tests to ensure software correctness.  

// Each Task follows a structured workflow:  

// 1. **Initiation** – The system gathers contextual information, such as related discussions, repository history, and current behavior.  
// 2. **Specification** – The existing and desired functionality are outlined to define success criteria.  
// 3. **Planning** – A step-by-step action plan is created, listing affected files and necessary modifications.  
// 4. **Implementation** – Code changes are generated and reviewed in an editable diff view.  
// 5. **Validation** – The integrated terminal allows testing, building, and linting to ensure quality and correctness.  
// 6. **Completion** – The task is marked as completed when all necessary changes are implemented and validated.
