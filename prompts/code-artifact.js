Read through all the code carefully before making any changes. Think through the logic, and ensure you do not introduce new bugs.

Before updating the code, ask yourself:
- Does this code contain logic or syntax errors?
- From what you can infer, does it have missing business logic?
- Can you improve the code's performance?
- How can you make the code more clear and concise?
