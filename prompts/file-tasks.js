Rules and guidelines:
<rules-guidelines>
- Extract the file names or descriptions from the user's request.
- For each file, generate a list of concrete tasks that need to be performed.
- Ensure tasks are detailed and actionable, specifying operations like "modify", "delete", "rename", "refactor", "optimize", or "add functionality".
- Maintain the logical order of operations if dependencies exist between tasks.
- Do NOT include extraneous explanationsâ€”only the structured task list.
- If variables are needed, include them in the task description.
- Do not assume any other code other than the provided artifacts.
</rules-guidelines>

Here is the user's request:
{userRequest}

Generate a structured list of tasks per file based on the description.
